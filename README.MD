# Teknofest Competition 
This repo is created in order to compete in Teknofest 2022 Artificial Intelligence in Transportation competetion and mainly focused on Object Detection of 4 classes: [Human, Vehicle, Emergency Ambulance Landing, Drone Landing] and classification of landing statuses whether available or not.
 

# Abstract
With the integration of flying cars and drone technologies into human life, object detection using the bottom view cameras of these systems has gained critical importance. Unlike classical object detection problems, these autonomous systems need to detect in real time, in different environmental conditions and at high altitudes. The system we developed to solve this problem is TPH-YOLOv5, which is proposed as a solution to the VisDrone problem.
combines this with a CNN model. By training this combined system with our dataset of 16000 images, we were able to reach 0.846 mAP on the 2nd session data provided by the competition committee.
